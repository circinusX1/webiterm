# webiterm
Tryin' to do a web term that don't suck, and is clear coded.


    * I am oanning to have all these
    * Wont have ssl. It is to be proxyed form your https server, so you use the apache2  / nginX proxy-mod
    * Start up command trough the url GET parameters or config
        * if you use this to to  reverse shells in some IOT devices, add the ssh -RN as statartup cmd
    * File transfer over the POST FORM as the web has
    * Black list commands. (you can block like: dd  fdisk  cd  and any command)
    * White list commands (you can allow cerain commands)
    * Intened to be part od a large management IOT portal from which you can manage IOT devices behind firewall
    * Intend to 'aka add reverse' shells on device over UDP punchtrug protocol as well (symetric encryption)


Work in progress.
  * Got the js data passed to server back and forward
